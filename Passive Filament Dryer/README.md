# Passive Filament Dryer

You can buy this kind of thing from Aliexpress for under 15$ shiped, or you can make this:

Simple passive filament dryer. My ideea was to not modify the palstic container, for some reason...
The rubber gasket from the container lid need to be trasfered into the filament dryer base. If you want the filament to come out from annother direction (further up, from the top, etc) feel free to drill a suitable hole into the plastic container for some connectors ( example: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0DDT1NGJ9 ) and use it as you want. 

For drying agent use silica gel dessicant direct in the base, or silica gel dessicant bags, or, maybe something like these: https://www.printables.com/model/65922-silica-gel-spool-container  - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6028663  placed in the middle of the spool.

BOM:

- Filament: use filament that its not crazy to absorbe moisture, maybe PLA, ABS, ASA... PETG not good

- Print with at least 4-5 tops and bottoms, and 4-5 walls. This needs to be air-tight to be efficient, or it does not make sense printing. Infill of your choice. The laches need to be printed from ABS or ASA, PLA will creep.

- Plastic container: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CFLJCJSF?th=1 - Please observe the container model, with tree ribs for handling. This is the container model I uset to trace the base for. Other type, maybe, will not fit.
