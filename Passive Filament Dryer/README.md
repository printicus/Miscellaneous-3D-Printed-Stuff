# Passive Filament Dryer

Simple passive filament dryer. My ideea was to not modify the palstic container, for some reason...
The rubber gasket in the container lid need to be trasfered into the filament dryer base. If you want the filament to come out from annother direction (further up, from the top, etc) feel free to drill a suitable hole into the plastic container for some connectors ( example: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0DDT1NGJ9 ) and use it like as you want. 


BOM:

- Filament: use filament that its not crazy to absorbe moisture, maybe PLA, ABS, ASA... PETG not good 

- Plastic container: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CFLJCJSF?th=1
           Please observe the container model, with tree ribs for handling. This is the container I uset to model the base for. Other type, maybe, will not fit.
